The module allows for easy communication between the __Electron__ and __AngularJS__ layers.  The module also provides direct access to __Electron__ itself!\r\n\r\n__Amy__ app stack is not for the unmotivated developer.  Both __AngularJS__ and __MaterialUI__ take some effort to master, but allow you to make some really awesome __Electron__ and __AngularJS__ desktop applications using popular and up-and-coming tools.\r\n\r\nFeel free to submit any issues, pushes, or [job offers](https://twitter/develephant). Thanks!\r\n\r\nTwit me up sometime @[develephant](http://twitter.com/develephant)\r\n\r\n___Amy Says, \"Code Awesome!\"___\r\n\r\n\r\n## Meet Amy App Stack\r\n\r\n__Amy__ consists of the following components:\r\n\r\nName | Function\r\n-----|---------\r\n[Electron](http://electron.atom.io) | Desktop application wrapper\r\n[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) | Single Page Application Framework\r\n[Angular Material UI](https://material.angularjs.org) | Google Material Design Widgets\r\n[ngElectron](https://github.com/develephant/ngElectron) | AngularJS Electron module\r\n[DiskDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diskdb) | MongoDB-like file based data storage\r\n[Material UI Icons](https://www.google.com/design/icons) | Google Material Design Icons\r\n\r\n## Installing __Amy__\r\n\r\nTo invite __Amy__ App Stack to your development environment, simply download the [__ZIP archive__](https://github.com/develephant/Amy/zipball/master) or [__TAR archive__](https://github.com/develephant/Amy/tarball/master). Once your download completes, decompress the downloaded archive.\r\n\r\n> __Rename the new directory with your own project name.__\r\n\r\nAt this point, you need to open your terminal, and navigate to the new project folder.\r\n\r\n`cd my-amy-project`\r\n\r\n`./amy-setup`\r\n\r\n> __If `amy-setup` won't open, you can try running `chmod +x amy-setup` first.__\r\n\r\nThis will set up all the dependencies for __Amy__. Once that's over, you're ready to code!\r\n\r\n### Running\r\n\r\nFor best demonstration results, you will need to open __Amy__ using the command line. You can the find the Electron __path__ by opening your [__Electron__](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases) loader. With the command line, navigate inside your __Amy__ project folder and run (for example OSX):\r\n\r\n`/Users/coronium/Desktop/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron .`\r\n\r\n> __Note the dot ' .' at the end.__\r\n\r\nHit enter, and this should open up the project and show console output. Play around with stuff.\r\n\r\n## ngElectron\r\n\r\n__Amy__ App Stack includes the [__ngElectron__](https://github.com/develephant/ngElectron) module for __AngularJS__ providing easy access to the __Electron__ \"host\" layer.\r\n\r\n#### Be sure to read up on it's full functionality at the [__ngElectron__](https://github.com/develephant/ngElectron) page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(c)2015 @develephant -\r\nAll rights reserved by the original owners, maintainers, and creators.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
