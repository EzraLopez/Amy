# Amy (AME) App Stack

__STATUS: In active development.__

![Amy is Awesome](https://s3.amazonaws.com/electron-assets/amy-app-small.png)

## Amy is Awesome!

__Amy__ App Stack is a _semi-opinionated_ [__AngularJS__](http://angularjs.org), [__Material UI__](https://material.angularjs.org), and [__Electron__](http://electron.atom.io)  project starter for your, soon-to-be, awesome __Electron__ App.

One major feature is the integration of the [__angElectron__](https://github.com/develephant/ang-electron) module for __AngularJS__.  The module allows for easy communication between the __Electron__ and __AngularJS__ layers.  The module also provides direct access to __Electron__ itself!

__Amy__ app stack is not for the unmotivated developer.  Both __AngularJS__ and __MaterialUI__ take some effort to master, but allow you to make some really awesome __Electron__ and __AngularJS__ desktop applications using popular and up-and-coming tools.

Feel free to submit any issues, pushes, or job offers. Thanks!
